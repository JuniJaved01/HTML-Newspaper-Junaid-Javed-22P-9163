- **Section:** 8A  

## Original Newspaper

## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML.  
The layout includes multiple columns, translated and rephrased headlines, article sections, and images.  
The structure is built using semantic HTML5 tags and a table-based column layout to match the original newspaper format.

## Features Implemented
- Proper HTML5 document structure  
- Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)  
- Table-based column layout  
- Multiple images with `alt` attributes  
- Inline styling for formatting and alignment  
- Proper heading hierarchy  
- HTML comments explaining major sections  

## Challenges Faced
Maintaining a multi-column newspaper layout without external CSS was challenging.  
This was solved using structured table layout and inline styling while keeping the code properly indented and readable.
